Make sure that required sockets library is installed in the system.
2) Run the script by typing "python server_new.py" this creates a server.
Follow the similar steps to create a client and connect to the server.

***IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS***
IP address of the server must be known beforehand to connect.
Once connected the server can control the command prompt of the client remotely by simply executing commands in just as one does in their own command shell.
